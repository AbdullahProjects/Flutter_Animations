# ðŸŽ¨ Learning Flutter Animations: Implicit vs Explicit

Flutter provides two main types of animations: **Implicit animations** and **Explicit animations**.

| Animation Type  | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **Implicit Animation** | Automatically animates changes in widget properties without needing a controller. Uses widgets like `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, etc. |
| **Explicit Animation** | Provides fine control over animations using an `AnimationController`. Requires manual handling of animation states. |

## ðŸš€ Implicit Animations

Implicit animations are easy to use and animate property changes smoothly. Below are some small projects demonstrating different implicit animations.

### ðŸ“Œ 1. Random Color Changing (Smooth Color Transition)

This example animates the background color of a `Container` when a button is pressed. Use **AnimatedContainer** to shift color from one to another within given time duration smootly.
